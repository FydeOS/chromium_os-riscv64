Subject: [PATCH] build: don't assume $BUILD_CC has fsmap.h just because $CC
 does

The $BUILD_CC toolchain might have an older set of Linux headers than
the $CC toolchain. It's generally unsafe to try to build both with the
same definitions, but in particular, this one can cause compilation
failures in the local crc32selftest build:

 In file included from crc32.c:37:
 In file included from ../include/xfs.h:37:
 ../include/xfs/linux.h:226:11: fatal error: 'linux/fsmap.h' file not found
 # include <linux/fsmap.h>
           ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's safe to always assume that the headers don't have getfsmap, since
the alternative just includes our local definitions anyway.
