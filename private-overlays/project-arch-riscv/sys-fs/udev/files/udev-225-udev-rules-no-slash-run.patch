Subject: [PATCH] Don't read udev rules from /run

Udev rules may contain command in RUN attributes. All runnable code in
Chrome OS must be subject to code verification, e.g. be located on the
verified root file system. /run isn't verified and mounted noexec, so
it's not appropriate to place code there. See also crbug.com/1072486.
