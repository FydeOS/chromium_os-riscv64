Chromium OS has different needs for fontconfig than is typical. Our list of
fonts is the same for every user (there is only one linux user anyway).
Also, the list can never change.

We explicitly list the font directories to be searched for fonts, which come
from the read-only partition.  This prevents potentially malicious fonts from
being installed in writable directories such as ~/.fonts that are not subject
to verification.  Explicitly listing every font directory allows us to specify
exactly which fonts we want in the font cache.  This is necessary so that we
can generate the font cache during build_packages and produce a prebuilt binary
with all the cache files.  This speeds up build_image for ARM boards by up to
9 minutes (crbug.com/205424).  The font directories are listed in the local.conf
file to make it easier to add or remove fonts in the future. Finally, by
excluding FC_FONTPATH we also make sure that nonexistent directories added in
ebuilds (/usr/local/share/fonts) are not searched.

In addition, we remove the rescan directive because the font list won't
change.
